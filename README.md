# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-the-LSTM-neural-network
Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, I will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. I will develop this project into two parts: First, we will learn how to predict stock prices using the Long short-term memory(LSTM) neural network. Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis. To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset. To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook.
